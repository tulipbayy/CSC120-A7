- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


Implementing overridden methods in the subclasses worked well to define specific behaviors for each building type, but clearer guidelines on method overloading would have been helpful for smoother implementation. Future students should ensure a thorough understanding of when and why to overload methods to improve code flexibility and maintainability.
